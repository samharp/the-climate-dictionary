They play a particularly crucial role in mainstreaming environmental action and conservation across different sectors of public policy, which is central to achieving each country’s commitments made under the Global Biodiversity Framework and the goals of the CBD. Incorporating mainstreaming as a major feature of the NBSAPs is important because many national environmental focal points are not present in the most influential departments or ministries.",

            "The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty adopted in 1992 to combat dangerous human interference with the climate system. It entered into force in 1994 and enjoys near universal membership, having been signed by 198 parties. It is the parent treaty of both the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol.",
            "The UNFCCC secretariat is the United Nations entity tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. The secretariat facilitates intergovernmental climate change negotiations by organizing between two and four negotiating sessions each year, the largest and most important of which is the Conference of the Parties (COP). It also provides technical expertise and assists in the analysis and review of climate change information and maintains the registry of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)."

            "Weather refers to atmospheric conditions at a particular time in a particular location, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, wind, and visibility. Weather conditions do not happen in isolation, they have a ripple effect. The weather in one region will eventually affect the weather hundreds or thousands of kilometers away.",
            "Climate is the average of weather patterns in a specific area over a longer period of time, usually 30 or more years, that represents the overall state of the climate system.",
            "Human activity in the industrial age, and particularly during the last century, is significantly altering our planet’s climate through the release of harmful greenhouse gases."
